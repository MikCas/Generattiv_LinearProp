# Generattiv_LinearProp

This artwork was generated by an algorithm written in the P5JS language. 
The algorithm explores the contrast between pixels moving in a strict linear direction and the opposing pixels moving in random motion, using complex boudaries.

A number of lines are generated all moving in a given linear direction. These lines are bounded by an inner bound which is defined by some function, such as a sqaure, or more complex trigonometric functions. 

Upon contact with the boundary, there is a probabilty that the line goes beyond the inner boundary or stays in linear motion within the inner bound. When the innerbound is exceeded the line start moving in random motion 
(until the line retreats back to the confides of the inner boundary).Interesting shapes and designs are created when choosing interesting functions and the contrast between the two states are clearly highlighted. 

There is also a global boundary which deflects any points coming towards it to the opposite direction as not point can go beyond this outer boundary.
